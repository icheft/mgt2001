## Intro
The goal for this python package is to provide NTUIM students with an easier solution for Statistics courses, i.e. MGT2001 and MGT2002. This can be labelling issues in bar charts, generating a set of colors, and many more. Throughout the course, we hope to fill this package with useful and handy functions that can be used in the assignments, quizzes, and probably even for the future projects. 

The official documentation for this package is available [here](https://icheft.github.io/mgt2001-docs).

## Getting Started
### Terminal
Should be able to install the package via PyPI:
```sh
pip install mgt2001
```

If you have already installed and are considering an update:
```sh
pip install mgt2001 --upgrade
```

### Notebook
If you are on Windows, this method probably serves you better. Just copy the above code onto any of the code blocks.

Should be exactly the same, but instead of copying and pasting the whole text, add a `!` at the beginning of the line.

It is installable via:
```sh
!pip install mgt2001
# or locally
%pip install mgt2001
```

or 

```sh
!pip install mgt2001 --upgrade
# or locally
%pip install mgt2001 --upgrade
```

Which again depends on your needs.
